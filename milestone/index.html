            <b>Project Summary</b>
            <br />
            With the codebase given in homework 4, we plan to implement
            physically based sound onto computer animations. We will synthesize
            appropriate sounds, based on different materials, forces, and other
            physical processes of an animation.
        </p>

            <b>Current Project Progress</b>
            <br />
            Within the past week and a half we have gone through all the code of
            HW 4 to understand the rendering pipeline of objects for the OpenGL
            GUI. We realized that adding other objects to render to HW 4 is a
            much more intricate process than we initially anticipated. We
            previously anticipated that we would be able to convert dae files of
            previous HWs to .json and render them in HW4, but upon investigating
            the code that is not possible because we do not have a parser for
            other objects that are not a plane, sphere, or cloth. Currently, we
            are investigating openGL-tutorial.org in hopes that we can obtain
            and implement a parser that would allow us to render other rigid
            objects into the HW 4 GUI. In the last week and a half, we also
            researched the PortAudio C++ library to implement sound into the
            existing HW 4 project. We adjusted the CMakeLists.txt files and
            project directory to build and implement the library, and a sine
            tone plays for 15 seconds upon opening the application.

            <b>Next Steps</b>
            <br />
            The bunny found in Homework 3 is the Stanford bunny, and is
            available in the PLY format online. Our approach to rendering the
            bunny will be to create our own class that inherits from
            CollisionObject.
            <br />
            Our new object can be similar to the sphere object, as it already
            contains a mesh structure. We will look into implementing a parser
            for either the PLY or the .obj format detailed in
            openGL-tutorial.org to read the bunny object into the required mesh
            struct. We were hoping to adjust the sound to correspond with the
            collisions by the bunny and cloth. We hope to first implement being
            able to play a sound when a collision occurs, then implement playing
            a sound that dynamically changes depending on the types of
            collisions and materials being used. Now that we have sounds
            playing, we can investigate where in the codebase we should play
            sound and how to play sound buffers that dynamically change
            depending on collisions. Due to our difficulties with adding other
            rigid objects to our HW 4 framework our previous plan from our Final
            Project Proposal needed to be updated. With our current progress and
            remaining time left for the project our new work plan is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Week 3</b>
            <br />
            Implement other rigid body objects to HW4 framework
            <br />
            Implement physical simulation for our added objects, rigid-motion
            simulation of CBbunny onto the plane (our “bounce”).
            <br />
            Implement cloth collisions with rigid-bodies (CBbunny)
            <br />
            Implement playing sounds through speakers
            <br />
            If we cannot implement other rigid body objects to our HW4 framework
            by the end of this week we will continue by adding simulation to the
            sphere. As well as, add sphere interactions with planes and cloths.

            <b>Week 4</b>
            <br />
            Implement cloth collisions with movements such as rubbing (if time
            permits pulling as well)
            <br />
            Research sounds based off rubbing of cloth (& pulling)
            <br />
            Implement collisions with other materials such as metal or wood
            <br />
            Research and implement sounds dependent on new materials
            <br />
            Implement stretch goals such as sound between moving objects if time
            permits
