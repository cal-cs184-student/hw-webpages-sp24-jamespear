        <p>
            In this homework, I implemented algorithms to render bezier curves
            and triangle meshes. I used the de Casteljau algorithm to draw 1D
            bezier curves, and using multiple of these 1D bezier curves, I was
            able to create bezier surfaces. I implemented area-weighted surface
            normals to achieve phong shading, and I implemented triangle edge
            flips, edge splits, and loop subdivision for mesh upsampling. I
            thought it was interesting to learn more about how objects are
            rendered in 3D and how smoothing occurs with time and space
            constraints. Implementing bezier curves and triangle meshes gave me
            a better understanding and intuition of how they are used in the
            real world.

        <p>
            The de Casteljau algorithm is a recursive algorithm that takes the
            repeated linear interpolation between control points to result in a
            smooth curve between these points. In order to implement the
            algorithm, I looped through every control point and took the
            interpolation between each pair of them. For n points, this
            interpolation results in n-1 points.

        >
        <p>
            The de Casteljau algorithm extends to bezier surfaces by combining
            several bezier curves together in 3D space. To create a surface from
            some set of n bezier curves in space S, define a space U orthogonal
            to S. For some point v in U, evaluate each of the bezier curves at
            point v, resulting in a set of points p1, p2, ..., pn. Evaluate each
            of these points as a bezier curve in space U. By applying this
            technique to all points in space U, a 3D bezier surface is created.
            I implemented this algorithm by recursively evaluating each point v
            for each bezier curve in space S. I formed bezier curves from the
            resulting points, and after looping over all points in U, I formed a
            3D bezier surface.

        <p>
            I implemented the area-weighted vertex normals by iterating through
            each of triangles incident to the vertex and added their normal
            vector scaled by their area to a running sum. After iterating
            through all triangles, I took the norm of that sum to yield the
            area-weighted vertex normal.

        <b style="font-size: 25px">Part 4: Edge Flip</b>
        <p>
            To implement the flip operation, I first drew a diagram of all the
            vertices, edges, faces, and halfedges of the triangles I start with
            and the triangles I hoped to end with. Next, I defined each of the
            vertices, edges, faces, and halfedges as new variables. Then, I
            redefined the next, twin, vertex, edge, and face components of each
            of the halfedges. After, I redefined the halfedge components of the
            verteices, edges, and faces. Lastly, I returned the original edge
            iterator that was passed in. I found following the guide linked on
            the debugging page very helpful in the process for this part, and
            after following that guide I had no debugging problems.

        <b style="font-size: 25px">Part 5: Edge Split</b>
        <p>
            My implementation process for edge splits was similar to edge flips.
            I drew a diagram including all vertices, edge, faces, and halfedges,
            and I translated that diagram into the new diagram I drew. The
            difference this time, though, was that I needed to define one new
            vertex, two new edges, two new faces, and six new halfedges. I
            defined these after defining all other components of the first
            diagram, and I redefined their components similarly. I defined the
            isNew component of the old edge that I split as false and the isNew
            component of the new edges as true. Again, following the guide was
            very helpful in making sure my code did not have any bugs.

            >Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</b
        >
        <p>
            I implemented loop subdivision by splitting each triangle into four
            triangles. To do this, I needed to calculate the positions of the
            old and new vertices using the loop subdivision rule before
            splitting, splitting all edges, flipping new edges that connected
            new and old vertices, and updating the positions of the new and old
            vertices. One bug I ran into was implementing the loop subdivision
            rule wrong, as I did not compute the sum of all neighboring vertices
            (also known as the centroid computation) correctly. I resolved this
            by using the computeCentroid function.
        </p>
        <p>
            After many loop subdivisions, I noticed that the sharp corners and
            edges of the cube get smoothed out and the cube becomes asymmetrical
            as seen below.

        <p>
            In order to mitigate these effects, we can preprocess some of the
            splitting and flipping of the cube so that the cube retains more of
            its symmetry and sharpness. Due to the weighting of the loop
            subdivision rule, the corners of the cube become normalized between
            the points that lie on the faces of the cube. Since the midpoint
            between these points is further inside the cube than the corner is,
            the corner point gets closer to the center of the cube and in turn
            gets rounded. The cube starts with one diagonal edge between two of
            its vertices, and since that edge is labeled as an old edge, it
            retains more of its sharp corner shape than the other vertices of
            the face due to how the loop subdivision rule handles vertex
            positions. Since those corners are sharper than the non-connected
            corners, the cube becomes asymmetrical. By splitting this edge at
            the beginning so every corner is connected by an edge before running
            our loop subdivision algorithm, our cube will stay symmetric, and by
            dividing the cube into smaller triangles before running our
            algorithm, the corners will retain more of their sharp shape and
            reduce rounding. Below is the steps of the loop subdivision with
            preprocessed edges.
