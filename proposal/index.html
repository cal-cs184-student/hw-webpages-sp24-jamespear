  <h3> Summary </h3>
  <p>
  We will be creating physically based sound from computer animations working with the codebase given in homework 4.
  Based on different materials, forces, and other physical processes of an animation, we will synthesize appropriate sounds.
  </p>

  <h3>Problem Description</h3>
  <p>
  Our group was interested in physical simulation and music and sound. We found a significant amount of research through SIGGRAPH of synthesizing sounds from graphical renderings and animations, so we thought it would be a good intersection between our interests.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our problem is synthesizing sounds based on physical graphical simulations. Adding sound to physical simulations is important to give more realism to the simulation, with applications in virtual reality, computer animation, and aids for the visually impaired. Our problem is challenging in generating sounds specific to the materials being used, the force and friction of objects interacting with each other, and a combination of both of these aspects. We plan to solve these problems through analysis of object collisions and parameters tuned specifically to the materials of different objects used.
  </p>

  <h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>
  <p>
    For our final project, we will be building an animation that is augmented by the use of sound rendering. We will use the objects that we rendered in Homeworks 3 and dropping objects (such as cloth) in 4 as a starting point. We will drop two instances of the CBbunny object onto the ground, modeling them with different materials – such as metal and stone, and allowing the object to bounce on the ground. We will then simulate appropriate sounds based on the motion of the objects and their interactions, as well as their material properties, as described in our reference paper (Doug L. James, Jernej Barbič and Dinesh K. Pai). Next, we will drop a cloth onto the bunnies, and drag it across once it rests. We will simulate an appropriate sound for each interaction between the cloth and the bunny objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system isn’t interactive, so the outputs we’ll create will be videos of rigid bodies and cloth of different materials being dropped, dragged, and the like, and emitting their respective sounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope to deliver more motions and materials. While we’ll start with just dropping and dragging, other motions like cloth billowing in the wind could be a good addition, as will new materials with distinct sounds beyond just metal, stone, and wood. We’ll need to modify how rigid bodies of these materials physically bounce or rattle when dropped or dragged as well, even though the ultimate focus is sound. We also hope that we’ll have the time to make multiple surfaces for these objects to hit or be moved across: instead of just a plane representing “the ground”, we can have our objects hit dirt, wooden tables, and the like to generate different sounds. This opens the path to generating the sound from collisions between moving objects, though that is an even further stretch goal.
